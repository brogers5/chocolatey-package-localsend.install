    <description><![CDATA[## LocalSend

LocalSend is a cross-platform app that enables secure communication between devices using a REST API and HTTPS encryption. Unlike other messaging apps that rely on external servers, LocalSend doesn't require an internet connection or third-party servers, making it a fast and reliable solution for local communication.

LocalSend uses a secure communication protocol that allows devices to communicate with each other using a REST API. All data is sent securely over HTTPS, and the TLS/SSL certificate is generated on the fly on each device, ensuring maximum security.

For more information on the LocalSend Protocol, see the [documentation](https://github.com/localsend/protocol).

## Package Notes

The installer executed by this package was built using Inno Setup. For advanced setup scenarios, refer to [Inno Setup's command-line interface documentation](https://jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=setupcmdline). Any desired arguments can be appended to (or optionally overriding with the `--override-arguments` switch) the package's default install arguments with the `--install-arguments` option.

Installer-specific details (e.g. Setup configuration and supported Languages, Components, and Tasks) can be found in the Inno Setup Script file, which should be [available in LocalSend's source code](https://github.com/localsend/localsend/blob/v1.15.0/scripts/compile_windows_exe-inno.iss) for quick reference.

For future upgrade operations, consider opting into Chocolatey's `useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades` feature to avoid having to pass the same arguments with each upgrade:

```shell
choco feature enable --name="'useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades'"
```
